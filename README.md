Modelling a simple turnstile as a FSM (Finite State Machine)

This code is an exercise on developing a simple turnstile simulator as a Finite State Machine.

Disclaimer: I really had a cybernetics book somewhere, but for now, we'll go with wikipedia.

As per wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) a finite-state 
machine (FSM) is a mathematical model of computation. It is an abstract machine that 
can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time. The FSM can 
change from one state to another in response to some inputs;the change from one 
state to another is called a transition. A FSM is defined by a list of states, its 
initial state, and the inputs that trigger each transition.

This exercise may, or may not be used as a initial step to develop a very, very 
simple, humble and unpretentious text-based, game engine.

The code is there. I hope you have fun. Enjoy!
